# P2PSIPMANET

This is a project exploring routing solutions for hierarchical MANETs.

The code in this repository is for the OMNET++ simulator and has dependencies on the projects Oversim and inetmanet.

To install and use:
- install OMNET++ version 4.6 (see omnetpp.org where the software and install guide can be found).
- clone projects inetmanet-2.0 and oversim in your working directory (github repos also available from NMAI-lab).
- clone project P2PSIPMANET into your working directory.
Import all three projects (file>import>general>existing projects into workspace) from the OMNET++ IDE.
- compile inetmanet (project > build project) then oversim, then P2PSIPMANET (warning: it's slow, particularly for oversim).
